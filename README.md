## Asking for help when stuck

```text
Hi [boss’s name],

Admittedly, I’m feeling a little stuck on [specific thing]. So far, I’ve tried [tactic you tried] and [tactic you tried], but I’m still not making the progress I’m hoping for.

Rather than continuing to spin my wheels on this, I figured I’d swallow my pride to see if I could lean on your expertise and insights to identify the best way forward from here.

Do you have any time on [day] when we could sit down for [time frame] and talk through the details?

Thanks,

```
